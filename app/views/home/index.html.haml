  %h1 Getting Started with ActiveSupport Concern
%section#how-to-overview.slide
  %h2 Overview
  %ol
    %li
      %h3 ActiveSupport is one of most important library of Rails Framework.
      %p Contain Various Utility function such as(check with rails c and irb command)
      %p  1) Cache Strategy, autoloading, eagerloading classes
      %p  2) Resolve Dependency 
      %p  3) Add various utility function to ruby defined classes
      %p  4) like adding hour, minute to numeric class
    %li
      %h3 
        ActiveSupport can be used for understanding rails structure and source code 
    %li
      %h3 
        It is used in Various gems building such mongoid-slug(checkout source code).

%section#what_is_active_support_concern.slide
  %h2
    What is ActiveSupport Concern?
  %ol
    %li  
      ActiveSupport concern is basically module consisting of some methods.
    %li
      It implement 
      %em
        append_features 
      instance method of Module.
      %h3  What 'append_features(mod)' function does?:
      %p
        When the module(implementing append_features) is included in another, Ruby calls append_features in these module, passing it the receiving module in mod.
    %li
      'append_features' and 'included' are two instance function of Module get invoked when module is included in other. 

%section#concept_in_implementation.slide
  %h2
    Implementation Concept 
  %ol
    %li
      Why ActiveSupport::Concern is useful, we first need to understand Ruby mixins.
    %li
      Mixins are “virtual classes” that have been injected in a class’s or module’s ancestor chain.   
    %p
      = succeed "." do
        %code code
    %pre
      %code
        :preserve
          module MyMod
          end

          class Base
          end

          class Child < Base
            include MyMod
          end

          # irb> Child.ancestors
          #  => [Child, MyMod, Base, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]                   
%section#concept1_in_implementation.slide
  %h2
    Implementation Concept 2
  %ol 
    %li
      Modules can also be used to extend objects, for example:
    %p
      = succeed "." do
        %code code 
    %pre    
      %code  
        :preserve
          my_obj = Object.new
          my_obj.extend MyMod
          # irb> my_obj.singleton_class.ancestors
          # #  => [MyMod, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
    %p
      When module extended by other, module method will became instance method  on an object’s singleton class.
    %p
      We will see through code in next section.

%section#concept2_in_implementation.slide
  %h2
    Implementation Concept 3
  %ol
    %p
      = succeed "." do
        %code code
    %pre
      %code
        :preserve
          module TestModule
            def check
              p 'in test module'
            end
          end
          
          class Test
            class << self
              include TestModule
            end
          end

          Test.check
    
    
%section#concept3_in_implementation.slide
  %h2
    Continue from Previous code
  %ol
    %li
      Method 'Check' in previous code known as singleton method(some also called static)
    %li
      Actually, there’s no such thing as static/class methods in Ruby. Rather, there are methods on a class’s singleton class.
    %pre
      %code
        :preserve
          class Test
          end
          Test.singleton_class.class_eval do
            define_method :class_aa do
              p 'class aaaa'
            end
          end
          Test.class_aa
    %li
      There is misconception about class_eval and instance_eval function.
%section#concept4_in_implementation.slide
  %h2
    Why to study include and extend ?
  %ol
    %li
      Include and Extend should not be used at same class/others  
    %li
      Same module should not be both extended and included in other.
    %pre
      %code
        :preserve
          module Test
            def wht
              p 'in module Test'
            end
          end
          class IncludeExtend
            include Test
            extend Test
          end
          IncludeExtend.wht
          IncludeExtend.new.wht
    %li
      What benefit above code provide us?
         
    %li
      Above code does not have practical usecase?
    %li
      Why would anyone want same method to be both instance and class method 
%section#concept5_in_implementation.slide
  %ol
    %li
      What if we want some method as class method and instance method of module to include
      in class?
    %li
      Can be done with the help of some metaproramming structure and above concept 
    %p
      %pre    
        %code
          :preserve
            module Person
              module DemoClass
                def live
                  p 'in live class method '
                end
              end
              module DemoInstance
                def personal_interest(interest)
                  p 'in instance method '
                end
              end
              def self.included(base)
                base.send :include, DemoInstance
                base.send :extend, DemoClass
              end
            end
%section#concept6_in_implementation.slide

      %pre
        %code{lang: "ruby"}
          :preserve
            class Rohan
              include Person
            end                   
        
    %li#extensions-goto.slide
      When person module get included in Rohan class, then
      %em 
        Module#included
      method get invoked passing the receiver object(here Person) 
    %li#extensions-menu.slide
      In above code, we have created two module inside main module 'Person'
    %li#extensions-hash.slide
      One of two module encapsulate class methods and other module encapsulate instance method
    %li#extensions-navigation.slide
      Using dynamic method invocation, we call include and extend method call on base object as shown in previous slide
    %li#extensions-navigation.slide
      When module is included, by default its get included as instance methods.

                extend ActiveSupport::Concern          
                module ClassMethods                     
                  def live                              
                    p 'in live class method '
                  end
                end

                def personal_interest(interest)
                  p 'in instance method '
                end
              end
              class Rohan
                include Person
              end
    %li
      No need to call extend and include methods on class object.
    %li
      What more ? or only these?

      :preserve
        def self.extended(base)
          base.instance_variable_set("@_dependencies", [])
        end
  %li
    When module extended with ActiveSupport::Concern, Ruby calls the self.extended method, and passes in our module
  %li
    ActiveSupport::Concern sets an instance variable on our module to an empty array. These will used to keep track of 
    modules our module depend on.

      %code
        :preserve
          def append_features(base)
          end
    %li
      append_features method get called by ruby when modules get included in other.
    %li
      ActiveSupport::Concern sets an instance variable on our module to an empty array. These will used to keep track of 
      modules our module depend on.
    %li
      Ruby’s default implementation is to add the constants, methods, and module variables of this module to base module.

            base.instance_variable_get("@_dependencies") << self
            return false
    %li
      If the module that our concern is included into has the dependencies instance variable, then it is assumed to be another concern and our concern is appended to it’s dependencies

            base.class_eval(&@_included_block) if instance_variable_defined?("@_included_block")
          end
    %li
      If the module is already included, then its simple return with false value
    %li
      If module has any dependencies module, it get iterated and included in our base so that all function defined in these modules get called on base and calls #super to perform Ruby’s default behavior.
    %li
      base extend any class method defined in module 
    %li
      it calls #class_eval on a block if it’s defined

            else
              super
            end
          end 
    %li
      ActiveSupport::Concern hijacks this method to give us a pretty syntax for declaring what should happen when our concern is included.
           
%section#service_object.slide
  %h2
    Service Object          
  %ol
    %li
      Service Object is not new concept in web programming.
    %li
      A 'service' describes system interactions. Usually, these will involve more than one business model in our application 
    %li
      As an example: we have a User model and this encapsulates a password. If a user has forgotten their password, the business rules dictate that we have to send them an e-mail with a link to reset it. This functionality is a service.
    %li
      Service objects implement individual services
%section#service_object1.slide
  %h2
    Service Object Vs ActiveSupport::Concern
  %ol
    %pre
      %code
        :preserve
          class ForgottenPassword
            def initialize(user_id)
              user = User.find user_id
              mail = UserMailer.password_reset @user
              mail.deliver
            end
          end
    %li
      Service Object or ActiveSupport::Concern are not alternative to each other.
    %li
      Service Object is needed when requirement is of discrete in nature(use in separation of logic which is much different and does not depend on others).
    %li
      ActiveSupport::Concern come into picture when functionality is interdependent on each others.
    %li 
      No special module or class is get included in creating  service object. One can make service directly under app/ or create file under lib.
